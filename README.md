List of personally hosted server apps on my server :-  

**- Heimdall**

This app works as the dashboard of all the apps that you will install on your server

**- Sonarr** :tv:

The best app for managing all the series you watch. Basically this app tracks and downloads all the future episodes that will release automatically or if you like will download all the episodes

**- Filerun**(Untested) :open_file_folder:

The file manager for your server. This basically gives you a Google Drive like feel for managing your files.

**- Plex Media Server** :tv:

I don't think this needs any explanation. This is currently the best media server you can hope for your media that you've downloaded on your server. You can use their apps to stream on your mobile devices as well.
